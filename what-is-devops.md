# What is DevOps?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Devops: all the undisciplined shit you usually expect from Linux admins, but run through Jenkins.

Multiple overlapping concerns:
- ease of setting up development stack
- automation of testing and integration into deployment pipeline
- document and automate deployment of production stack
- improve monitoring, logging, failure handling, and scaling of production


Problems:
- "environment"
- dependencies
- where can things break?
